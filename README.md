Also make sure to grab the Python dependencies by typing the following in your operating system's CLI at the project's directory:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run it, type the following in your operating system's CLI at the project's directory:
```
python3 Main.py
```

Make sure to add the bot token and ID of the host user to `Variables.yaml`. The host user then needs to type `+sync_commands` to make the slash commands show up and update.

Also make sure to type `+sync_guilds` and `+sync_users` after launching so that any guilds that added or removed this bot
and/or any users that joined or left any guilds with this bot during downtime can be properly added to or removed from storage.
